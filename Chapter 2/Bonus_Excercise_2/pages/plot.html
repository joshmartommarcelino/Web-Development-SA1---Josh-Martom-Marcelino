        <h1>Plot</h1>
        <p>Ted Lasso follows the journey of an American college football coach who is unexpectedly recruited to coach an English Premier League soccer team, AFC Richmond, despite having no experience in the sport. What the team's owner, Rebecca Welton, doesn't know is that Lasso's folksy, optimistic demeanor hides a shrewd tactical mind and deep understanding of human psychology.</p>
        <p>As Ted navigates the challenges of coaching a sport he knows little about, he wins over the skeptical players, staff, and fans with his unique blend of homespun wisdom, unwavering positivity, and genuine care for everyone around him. The series explores themes of leadership, personal growth, friendship, and the power of believing in people and second chances.</p>
